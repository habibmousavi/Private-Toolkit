<p>One day, a poor boy who is selling goods from door to door to pay his way through school, finds that he has only one thin dime left, and he is hungry. He decides to ask for a meal at the next house. However, he loses his nerve when a lovely young woman opens the door.
Instead of a meal he asks for a drink of water. She thinks he looks hungry, so she brings him a large glass of milk. </p>
<p>He drinks it slowly, and then asks, “How much do I owe you?”
“You don’t owe me anything,” she replies. “Mother always tells us not to accept pay for a kindness.”</p>
<p>He says, “Then I thank you from my heart.”</p>
<p>As Howard Kelly leaves that house, he not only feels stronger physically, but his faith in God and man is strong also. Now, he does not want to give up like minutes before.</p> 
<p>Years later that young woman becomes critically ill. The local doctors are baffled. They finally send her to the big city, where they call in specialists to study her rare disease.</p>
<p>Dr. Howard Kelly is called in for the consultation. When he hears the name of the town she comes from, a strange light fills his eyes. Immediately he rises and goes down the hall of the hospital to her room.</p>
<p>Dressed in his doctor’s gown he goes in to see her. He recognizes her at once. He goes back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day he gives special attention to the case.</p>
<p>After a long struggle, the battle is won. Dr. Kelly requests the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looks at it, then writes something on the edge and sends it to her room. </p>
<p>She fears to open it, for she is sure it will take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looks, and something catches her attention on the side of the bill. She begins to read the following words:</p>
<p>“Paid in full with one glass of milk.</p>
<p>Signed, Dr. Howard Kelly.”</p>
